Introduction

Python's simplicity, portability, and excellent library support makes development of
applications very quick and easy.  The Python wrapper allows developers to access
Centera SDK functions in a native manner and utilize the object-oriented and rich
library capabilities of the language.



Architecture

The Python wrapper uses a C extension module to provide bindings into the Centera C
SDK.  These native C function calls are then encapsulated within an object oriented
class as a Python library.



General Prerequisites

+ Must be run on a supported Centera SDK platform (Centera SDK must be installed).
+ Centera SDK 3.1 or above.
+ Python Interpreter 2.4 or above.

Windows Prerequisites

+ the SDK .NET Framework SDK needs to be installed before building extensions for
Python.



Installation

1)  Place all Centera SDK shared libraries in the python customized package
directory.

  e.g. /usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages

2)  Save the Python wrapper source package in a local directory on the system.

  e.g. tar zxvvf python-cas-sdk-wrapper-0.1.tar.gz

3)  Define CENTERA_HOME environment variable to point to your top level Centera
SDK path.

  e.g. export CENTERA_HOME=/usr/local/Centera (linux)
  e.g. set CENTERA_HOME=c:\Centera (windows)

4)  Run the setup.py script in the src directory to install and compile the Python 
wrapper code.

  sudo CENTERA_HOME=/usr/local/Centera python setup.py install



Uninstallation

1)  Remove the following files/folders from the Python customized package directory:

  a)  Remove Filepool directory
  b)  Remove FPNative.so
